Hands-on Linux training with daily labs and shell scripting

# Linux Fundamentals Labs

This repository contains daily hands-on Linux training exercises designed to build proficiency in:

- Bash and shell scripting
- User and group management
- Networking and firewall configuration
- System monitoring and process control

Each folder (day1, day2, etc.) contains scripts, notes, and lab files created during my journey to mastering Linux.
